                <h2> About us</h2>
                <p>
                    Femke and Margriet are like sisters to eachother, they knit together, they cook together, and they go on wild adventures, such as going to the market! Amazing!
                    They have been friends/sisters for an exceptionally long time: four whole weeks! In this time, they shopped a lot and found that they shared interests in expensive stuff. 
                    They found that they shared the opinion that it was too expensive, and tried to replicate things they saw in the store together. This made them realise there was money to be made!
                    <br>

                <h2>Femke</h2>
                <p>
                    Femke started out as a food blogger, but after a vicious attack of vegans after a delicious recipe she posted, she wanted a change of pace. Her hobbies are horseback riding, knitting and yoga.

                <h2>Margriet</h2>
                <p>
                    When Margriet was tired of being successful at her job as Agile Scrum Worker, she decided she could take matter into her own hands. Her hobbies are sitting on the porch drinking whine, gardening and running.
